I'm a quantitative researcher at [Ubiquant](https://ubiquant.com/website/about), one of China's leading private quant firms, managing over 55 billion RMB. Before my industrial career, I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Peking University, under the supervision of Prof. [Ming Zhang](http://net.pku.edu.cn/dlib/mzhang/) in 2021. I worked with Prof. [Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/) at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) during Sept. 2018 - Sept. 2019.
